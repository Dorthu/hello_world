# hello_world

A program to output the phrase "hello world"

## Design Goals

hello_world is designed to be as simple and readable as possible.  To achieve
this goal, I have removed esoteric, confusing lines like `print`, and opted to
use more readable functions and decorators with more obvious functions.  In
addition, I have taken great care to remove "magic strings" from the program
logic, and tried to divide concerns between different files as best as possible
to make them more portable.

Special thanks to @sircmpwn for the inspiration for this project.  If there is
any code that is at all confusing, esoteric, or otherwise efficient, please 
submit a PR and I will further obfuscate simple logic into one-line functions.
